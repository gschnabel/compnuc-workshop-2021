## Lecture on probabilistic methods for nuclear data

This repository contains the presentation on
probabilistic methods for nuclear data which was
given at the [Workshop on Computational Nuclear Science and Engineering][compwork] on 13 July 2021.

It is an introduction to Bayesian inference based on the multivariate normal distribution,
as it is used in nuclear data evaluation. Approaches to solve the Bayesian update equation
are outlined. Finally Gaussian process regression is explained and it is shown how it
can be used to deal with imperfect models in Bayesian inference.

The videos are embedded in the pdf file but are also provided as extra files
if the pdf viewer is not able to render them properly.
The R script to produce the plots and animations with Gaussian processes is
also included in this repository.
Please note that PowerPoint may not accurately render the odp-format.
